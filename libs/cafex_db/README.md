CAFE-DB provides a set of intuitive methods and classes to facilitate database testing. Here's a basic example:

```python
from cafex_db import database_handler

# Create a database connection
db_handler = database_handler.DatabaseHandler()
connection = db_handler.create_connection(db_type="mssql", server="dbserver", database="testdb")

# Execute a query
result_set = db_handler.execute_query(connection, "SELECT * FROM users")

# Convert the result set to a list
result_list = db_handler.resultset_to_list(result_set)

# Validate the data
assert result_list[0][1] == "John Doe"
